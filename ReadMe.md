# Flipper Zero GameCenter


This is a fork from the default generic flipper repository as of 0.58.1

The screen for locking and setting your PIN has a third option called "DUMB menu". if you select it on a 
vanilla build, you get a message that says "Not implemented". 

We implemented something. 

The plan is to create a screen suitable for a non-reading person to select between a number of games. 
The current work is on a branche called gamecenter.
